<!-- think about what we want the UI to be before going much further -

-do a ship counter for player and opponent
-do a message center - when sunk a piece

-square event listeners - 
  different fill for pieces vs normal squares vs. sunk ships (grey (prob with outline), light blue, red)
  white dot for misses, red dot for hits

  mouseover highlight as green if available shot, no highlight if unavailable

  onclick plays round if available shot, does nothing if unavailable

  player - 
    dots for hits and misses
    open / ship / sunk highlighting and border
    no event listeners (after piece placement)

  computer - 
    dots for hits and misses
    open / ship / sunk highlighting and border (border only after sunk?)
    mouseover shot availability
    onclick round if shot available



  how ships represented, do we want a ship counter, look at extra credit stuff, etc. -->
